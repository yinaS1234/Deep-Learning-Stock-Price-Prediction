# Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning ðŸ“ˆðŸ§ 

This research leverages deep learning to predict stock prices across 100 S&P 100 stocks, evaluating models like LSTM, CNN, and RNN. What makes this project unique is its dual focus: identifying the most accurate model and determining which model is better at generating Alpha excess returns, providing actionable insights for trading strategies

### Key Highlights:
- **Objective**: To assess the predictive accuracy and practical trading utility of different deep learning architectures.
- **Results**:
  - **LSTM** emerged as the most reliable model for both short- and long-term forecasts, achieving the lowest prediction error across all forecast windows.
  - **CNN+LSTM** performed well but did not surpass LSTM, while **CNN** excelled in short-term forecasting but struggled with longer horizons.
  - **RNN** had the highest prediction errors, making it the least effective model.
  - **Alpha analysis** demonstrated LSTM's potential for generating short-term excess returns, emphasizing its suitability for trading-focused applications.
- **Future Scope**: Exploration of transformer models and integration of external factors like economic indicators or investor sentiment to further enhance prediction accuracy and profitability.
