# Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning 📈🧠

## Project Overview
This research investigates the performance of advanced deep learning models—LSTM, CNN, RNN, and CNN+LSTM—in predicting stock prices across 100 U.S. stocks from the S&P 100, spanning diverse sectors. The models were evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Alpha**, across forecast windows ranging from 20 to 250 days.

### Key Highlights:
- **Objective**: To assess the predictive accuracy and practical trading utility of different deep learning architectures.
- **Results**:
  - **LSTM** emerged as the most reliable model for both short- and long-term forecasts, achieving the lowest prediction error across all forecast windows.
  - **CNN+LSTM** performed well but did not surpass LSTM, while **CNN** excelled in short-term forecasting but struggled with longer horizons.
  - **RNN** had the highest prediction errors, making it the least effective model.
  - **Alpha analysis** demonstrated LSTM's potential for generating short-term excess returns, emphasizing its suitability for trading-focused applications.
- **Future Scope**: Exploration of transformer models and integration of external factors like economic indicators or investor sentiment to further enhance prediction accuracy and profitability.
